This is where you can place an alternative texture.
For the sake of the repository size, I will not push these in here.

This will include:
	- HDRI
	- Textures

How to add a texture above:
	1.) Go to the credits, and look for the texture with higher resolution
		- This will be marked with a [+]
	2.) Go to the download link and download the desired resolution of the texture
	3.) Follow the file structure inside the Default folder and apply it to the Alternative
		- Make sure you check the Folder Name, and File Names, they should match!
	4.) Press the checkbox for the "Use Alternative Folder" in ImGui
	5.) Congrats, you are now using the textures inside the Alternative Folder!
